Here are a few more parts from the [nZk]004 booklet interview.

mpi: What's the difference between Western and Japanese music?
Sawano: There are a lot of differences. But the most obvious is the choice of groove and sound.

mizuki: What was the most shameful thing in your life?
Sawano: (laughs) In high school, after gymnastics I returned to class. I forgot that the girls were changing their clothes. I opened the door, and.. saw something I didn't want to see.

Aimee Blackschleger: At what age did you decide to become a composer?
Sawano: Back in high school, I started to get involved in music. But I decided to become a composer at the age of 16 after buying electronic instruments.

Aimer: Tell me, please.. what is your favorite food?
Sawano: Potatoes, coffee, Brussels sprouts.

Benjamin: What English-singing bands do you like?
Sawano: I'm a big fan of Aerosmith.

naNami: Who is your favorite performer in the world?
Sawano: CHAGE & ASKA would be that. Then comes some western music, namely Steven Taylor from Aerosmith and Chad Kroeger from Nickelback. Of the singers, I like Avril Lavigne and Sia the most.

Mica: Where do you get your inspiration from?
Sawano: I think it's from listening to a variety of different songs
