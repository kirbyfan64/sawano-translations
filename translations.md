## [nZk]004 Q&A

> *As you know, in 2016 the live concert [nZk]004 was held. And with this, the special Q&A project for the concert was done, in which fans asked questions from Sawano. All questions and answers were published in the concert booklet for 004. Here are the translations:*

**Q: Your piano produces the deepest impression. You also use a lot of electronic tools. Do you remember when you bought your first electronic musical instrument?**

A: In high school. I bought the YAMAHA EOS 900 Synthesizer.

**Q: Are there any songs like My☆ in which we can hear your singing?**

A: My voice can be heard in the song z29ba2t0t1l301e17.

**Q: When creating an arrangement of a song, you add electronic sounds. Do you use your own equipment to complete the work on the song? Or are you helped by people who work with this sort of equipment?**

A: I do it myself.

**Q: What do you do when you're not working?**

A: I watch TV.

**Q: What do you look for when choosing vocalists? Every time all the vocalists are simply unmatched!**

A: The most important thing is the voice.

**Q: With what tools do you work at home?**

A: Piano. At home, I create music using a computer and keyboard. I don't have a guitar, organ or percussive instruments (laughs).

**Q: Sawano-san, do you have time to listen to music? I do! Your songs make me cry.**

A: I do. The songs of the band "CHAGE & ASKA" moved me many times and gave me courage.

**Q: What is your blood type?**

A: O

**Q: What is your week like?**

A: Monday to Friday: making music, eating, watching movies, good sleep. From Saturday to Sunday: rest.

**Q: How long does it take to create a song?**

A: About 3-4 hours. Depends on the composition and its length.

**Q: I heard that you like to watch movies. What was your favorite movie from recent times?**

A: Batman (The Dark Knight) by Christopher Nolan.
**Q: How do you change your facial expressions? Your heart tells you to do this?**

A: It's just a face. It always happens very quickly (laughs).

**Q: In Spring of 2015, there was an audition to choose a vocalist to work with you. Please tell me, why did you choose Tielle?**

A: I had the opportunity to meet with the candidates directly to listen to their singing. Tielle had a very powerful voice.

**Q: Tell me about the names of the tracks.**

A: To give normal names to songs - for me, that isn't interesting. In addition, to come up with such names would be very boring.

**Q: String instruments are used in your work. But I notice you do not use woodwind instruments.**

A: Personally, I believe that a wooden instrument will give the music a great sound. But to give firmness and gloom together with percussion instruments, the main attention will be directed to string and brass instruments.

**Q: Question from Venezuela: I've always wanted to know what nZk means.**

A: I already talked about this at the [nZk]003 concert.

**Q: What color would you describe your own music with?**

A: Dark Blue.

**Q: What is the most stressful thing in your live performances?**

A: Overture in the pianoforte.

**Q: You created a lot of music. What kind of music was most difficult for you?**

A: Creating music for the drama 'Ns' Aoi', probably. I think the difficulty came from it being my debut work as a composer. It was the deciding factor on how I would continue to work.

**Q: It is time to ask about your phobia of aircraft.**

A: I have not overcome it yet.

**Q: The most important thing when creating your music?**

A: To enjoy it.

## [nZk]004 Q&A (part 2)

> Here are a few more parts from the [nZk]004 booklet interview.

***mpi:*** **What's the difference between Western and Japanese music?**

***Sawano:*** There are a lot of differences. But the most obvious is the choice of groove and sound.

***mizuki:*** **What was the most shameful thing in your life?**

***Sawano:*** (laughs) In high school, after gymnastics I returned to class. I forgot that the girls were changing their clothes. I opened the door, and.. saw something I didn't want to see.

***Aimee Blackschleger:*** **At what age did you decide to become a composer?**

***Sawano:*** Back in high school, I started to get involved in music. But I decided to become a composer at the age of 16 after buying electronic instruments.

***Aimer:*** **Tell me, please.. what is your favorite food?**

***Sawano:*** Potatoes, coffee, Brussels sprouts.

***Benjamin:*** **What English-singing bands do you like?**

***Sawano:*** I'm a big fan of Aerosmith.

***naNami:*** **Who is your favorite performer in the world?**

***Sawano:*** CHAGE & ASKA would be that. Then comes some western music, namely Steven Taylor from Aerosmith and Chad Kroeger from Nickelback. Of the singers, I like Avril Lavigne and Sia the most.

***Mica:*** **Where do you get your inspiration from?**

***Sawano:*** I think it's from listening to a variety of different songs

## Nanatsu no Taizai Song Descriptions

> Found some rough translations of the interview where Sawano describes each track on the first NnT OST. Some really interesting stuff here (it seems the translator is unsure on some things, so he mentioned those with a ?). The reason I didn't link the interview is because it was in Russian, and I used my own translation skills along with some tools to make sure that most people here understand this.
Prepare for a lot of posts in a row.

**1. Perfect Time:**

In this song I wanted to have sort of a "choir" of singing. Not all vocals are included in this track, but this is the only vocal song in The Seven Deadly Sins. I was happy when I heard this song in the first episode of the anime. Some think that this is a song about Elizabeth, as the lyrics start with "Elizabeth". But in fact it is about Meliodas. In the first half, I used celtic elements, depicting England *(?)**. In my previous work, I did not include celtic music in the songs, so this track has fresh and new emotions that I really like.

**2. 7角:the1:**

The title stands for The Seven Deadly Sins. While the first track Perfect Time is the theme of Meliodas, this second track is the main theme of the anime. The 17th song Big罪罪罪罪罪罪罪 uses a similar motif to the main theme.

**3. 銅鑼Gong4N:**

This song is used in each of the intros at the beginning of the episodes. But originally, this song was written for fight scenes. I thought that the track 7角:the1 would be more fitting for the intros *(?)*. For the orchestral part I used the bandoneon (musical instrument), as well as for Perfect Time. This track is one of my favorites.

**4. dEvilGODfamily復活動:**

This song contains two songs in the first and second half. Both of them represent the "revival of the demons". In the second half of the song there are voices by the president of Legendoor (Horiguchi) and myself (laughs). Since all the lyrics were improvised, many thought that the song just has meaningless words (laughs). But I think that you can understand that we were saying "Great Sin" in the song *(?)*.

**5. 世紀4:**

This orchestral song represesnts the Holy Knights' Kingdom Liones. I was told to write a song "with a heavy atmosphere". I wrote this song to have a dark atmosphere and tried to express some sort of changes in the Kingdom, some sort of feeling that it had been attacked by something unknown.

**6. YoSay&B→A:**

The second half of the song is the motif for Ban's prison escape *(?)*. The first half of the song is used for flashback scenes with Elaine. By the way, B → A in the title means Ban.

**7. 广2tree02 ネ日|-血:**

The title of the song stands for Blood of Demon. The song represents the demons. The song contains cries. From the beginning to the middle of the song, you can only hear my voice. I'm pronouncing the names of the seven deadly sins, for example "Dragon Sin", "Serpent Sin" etc. Please do not be disappointed if you find out that it was in fact my voice in the song (laughs). These words are present towards the end of the song as "zai" and "sin". I asked the members of the recording team to help me with singing these words.

**8. KAN594:**

This song was written for the four men who guarded the Baste Dungeon. I was told to write a song with the theme of "transforming attacks/attackers" *(?)* (laughs). Something about "strange enemies attacking, with a suspicious and aggressive atmosphere". In this orchestral song there is a completely different atmosphere compared to the other songs for the fight scenes.

**9. Eri0ne$:**

The theme of Elizabeth - one of my favorite songs. In fact, this song was written 10 years ago. I though that the song perfectly fits the description of "feelings, emotions and faith - Elizabeth.". Therefore, I have included this song in the soundtrack, only slightly changing the arrangement. This song does not represent the Elizabeth that Meliodas protects. In this song, Elizabeth will do anything to help the others.

**10. 駄メ男rIs:**

This is the theme song of Meliodas, but not for the serious and action-oriented scenes. Its' meant for funny and comical scenes. For example, the scene where he sexually harasses Elizabeth. In my previous work there wasn't much improvisation. This song is very improvised. I wrote this funny song for quite a long time *(?)*.

**11. EP←K:**

The first and second half of this song are different songs. In the first half of the song, it sounds a bit like a modified *銅鑼Gong4N*. In the first episode there is a chase scene with knights and Elizabeth. This song plays in that scene. (explanation of the title: EP←K = Elizabeth Princess<-Knights). The second half of the track is actually supposed to be a seperate song. I felt like I had to do something similar. I often write ad-lib songs on the piano. These songs are not mixed and not included in the soundtrack. But I wanted to put this song somewhere and it turned out to be merged with the first half of this track.

**12. Deerン怒&過多6-$:**

The first half of this song is the theme of Diana, and the second is the theme of Hawk. For the theme of Diana I was given orders to use "large" instruments. So I used drums, tubas and kettledrums. For Hawk the orders were "it must sound ridiculous". So I tried to apply a sense of fun through a variety of tools and instruments. For example I used a toy piano.

**13. mouth×宣華 ○2LI:**

This song is theme of the festival fight. I tried to express the feeling of festivals in this song. You can hear "Ho!" and "Huh!" screaming in this song. It was my voice, as well as President and guitarist Tsubakimoto-kun's voice (laughs). There is also a woman's voice, which was made on a computer.

**14. OH92&HrBrM:**

This is the theme of Helbram and the Kingdom of Liones *(?)*. While writing the song, I imagined the image of Britain, so I had the orchestra use bagpipes.

**15. GR雷:**

The first and second half are different songs. The first half was used in episode 8 in the last scene with Elaine. It sounded like *YoSay&B→A* with a new arrangement. Initially I did not plan to include the first half of this song in the soundtrack, as it was used to promote the anime *(?)*. The second half of the song was written to fit Gilthunder. Since he was originally a villain, I wanted to make a scary song. Using a synthesizer and organ, I wanted to do something unusual. I also put in a cello with electronics and processed sounds.

**16. らゲ-sin:**

This is a song for Meliodas, but it focuses on his past. There are also other songs on this OST that are about Meliodas. But in this song, there are motifs of sadness and tragedy, made with strings and a piano.

**17. Big罪罪罪罪罪罪罪:**

This is the theme of The Seven Deadly Sins. It uses the same motif as the second song in the soundtrack. I was told that this track will be used in the first episode of the anime. So I did a longer arrangement of the main theme. At the beginning of the soundtrack recording, I thought what song I should put at the end of the soundtrack, *7角:the1* or *Big罪罪罪罪罪罪罪*. I decided on this track because I think it sounded like a better song to end on.

## FANTASIA Comments

> So the site contains quite a bit of text where Sawano comments on the CD. VK translated it and I used their translation as a base for my own one (as Russian is much easier for me than Japanese). There's some parts here where I was unsure on what they meant, but other than that it should be pretty informative. *Original text taken by VK from this site: http://www.rittor-music.co.jp/s/sawanohiroyuki/)*

> Comments by Hiroyuki Sawano on the special CD which includes works that he made during his student years.

While studying at school I made a CD that contains songs that are very similar to fantasy soundtracks. The album is called *FANTASIA*. Tracks 1-7 on this CD are very fantasy-like (or part of the *FANTASIA* section).

At first I really liked *Final Fantasy*. But after listening to Mademoiselle Mozart by Tetsuya Komuro, I could feel the atmosphere of fantasy. Inspired by this, I did all of the songs on a YAMAHA EOS B900. This work for me was sort of an experiment, where I tried to reproduce an orchestra.

It all starts with a quiet part in the first song. Second song (unsure on what is said here). The third song is a theme of a city with a happy melody. The fourth song is heroic music fitting for a hero who goes around the world. The fifth song is a romance song between the hero and the heroine. The sixth song is a boss theme. The seventh song is the ending theme. The ninth song is a new version of `1st Mov: [Open a title page] ~ 物語 の 始 ま り ~`. I added some new parts but the arrangement hasn't changed much overall.

I put the CD in the book for young readers who dream of making music and are confident in their abilities and in their music. When I was young I heard that music critics listened to this CD *(?)*. And it was not a very good response from their side *(again, a bit unsure on this)*. But I have not changed much since then. In fact, when I was arranging the ninth song, I felt that I could use it for some games. So I want young composers to listen to this CD, be convinced in what they are doing now and continue their work in the future.

Incidentally, the eighth song is in the style of techno, which I wrote while in school for my friend's film.

## Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress (w/ Tetsuro Araki, director)

> Interview with Hiroyuki Sawano and Tetsuro Araki, where they talk about their work on the anime 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress'.

**Q: After Guilty Crown and Attack on Titan, Kabaneri was your third collaboration. What was your first meeting like?**

***TA:*** First of all, I learned about Sawano-san after the first episode of Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. From the themes during the culminative scenes of Unicorn, I was impressed. I thought it was a pity that I do not have a man who would write such songs. To be honest, I was quite jealous.

***HS:*** Yes, you talked about that.

***TA:*** After that, we started working on Guilty Crown. Sawano-san is primarily known for creating dramatic music, so I asked him to use all means to create that sort of music.

***HS:*** It was around the time when I was working on the music for the anime Blue Exorcist.

**Q: And in five years time, what do you think about the personality and style of each other?**

***HS:*** Director Araki makes a very strong impression. It is quite normal for his work to turn out to be incredible. The energy coming from the director is passed on to me every time, and I believe that I should return the same energy using my music. In addition, Araki listens to the music I make for his shows a lot, and is very grateful.

***TA:*** I really appreciate it. From my point of view, Sawano-san is a very bright person, and I wonder how he can write such dramatic music with a smile on his face (laughs). During the concerts he is also very cheerful. Thanks to the dramatic music that he makes, the emotions and feelings of the shows are greatly enhanced.

***HS:*** No, no, no, it's unexpected. When I'm writing a song, I'm completely different (laughs). I'm just being impatient and talking very fast.

***TA:*** Meetings with Sawano-san always end very quickly. Even if he had to talk for two hours, then our conversation is always less than two hours. Even if it is a very long conversation, Sawano-san always says: "Yes, yes, I understand, everything is alright!" (laughs)

***HS:*** I remember how Araki-san hurried me in one meeting and he kept saying "Sawano-san, I'll be going home soon". But in reality that wasn't the case. There are people who carefully study and think about the music, and think of what sort of atmosphere is required. And they give out some ideas. But I'm not like that: I can just sit in front of my computer and listen to the finished songs, until there is an idea. But this time I'll try to talk a little longer. (laughs)

**Q: Let's talk about Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. How did this project start?**

***TA:*** The animation studio Wit, who worked on Kabaneri, is the best when it comes to action. I tried to do a work that can compete with most other anime. We planned to make a project that was quite different from others of its genre.

**Q: Zombies in Steampunk Japan.**

***TA:*** If the main character kills someone, how can I prevent him/her from being hated.. I thought about it and added zombies to the anime. Unlike people, when killing zombies, people will not feel disgusted. To be honest, there are many reasons for me adding them, but this is the biggest one.

**Q: What about the music of Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress?**

***TA:*** I felt that it was not necessary to make the music too "Japanese". I thought I'd ask Sawano-san about the music. And for this anime I didn't give him any direction on the music. Listening to the music he sent me, I said: "It's amazing, this will work really well in the show!". So I wanted Sawano-san to not limit himself when creating music.

***HS:*** I'm happy that Araki-san always supports me. Of course, there are specific works where it is necessary to do something specific, and for those I am given detailed instructions. But I prefer to work freely, without limiting myself. If you say "please stick to Japanese music", then the range of musical approaches is narrowed, and there will be a lot of similar songs. I want to express my opinion about the world of work, combining different genres.

**Q: Which songs do you find to be especially impressive in the show?**

***HS:*** Of course, there are many, but there is one that is very strong - this is the main theme, "KABANERIOFTHEIRONFORTRESS". I put all of my energy into it, and you could first hear it in the scene where Ikoma became a Kabaneri. I was very happy with how that scene turned out with the music. In addition, vocal songs are also used in the anime in action scenes, but Araki-san also used them in fun scenes. I liked that the song Warcry was used in the action scene with Mumei.

***TA:*** When listening to music, there are situations where the songs are not particularly impressive. But if these songs are combined with scenes in the anime, then they will sound more emotional than expected. In other words, I care about how I combine music and the show. If the emotions in the scene and music combine, then that scene will turn out really well. In KABANERIOFTHEIRONFORTRESS, the main theme, there is no doubt that it caused a lot of the "emotional explosions". In all the scenes in which a battle was won, this song is played. I know that as soon as that song is played, victory is just a few steps away.

**Q: Especially in the battle scene of the 6th episode, it worked very well. Sawano-san, what was it like watching the anime as a spectator?**

***HS:*** Firstly, it's great that this anime has very high quality animation. In addition, I often watched anime when I was about 20 years old. Unlike the current fashionable anime, when watching Kabaneri it was nice to plunge into the atmosphere of old anime again. Perhaps Haruhiko Mikimoto's designs contributed to the strong feel of the show.

***TA:*** The design of the characters in the anime, namely the adults and children, is very similar to the 80s. There is no doubt that they were influenced by Mobile Suit Gundam directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino, which I really like. Kabaneri was a work that showed the old animation using modern technologies.

***HS:*** Yes, yes! But I thought that Princess Mononoke also had an impact on Kabaneri, namely the similar style of old Japan. Later, I realized that I could compose songs that fit this setting.

***TA:*** Of course, Old Japan in Princess Mononoke had a huge impact on Kabaneri. Despite the fact that this anime uses "old" animation, I made sure it looked natural like modern anime. For example, I decided that the hairstyle of characters should be shown through modern animation.
**Q: Sawano-san, what scene did you like the most?**

***HS:*** Scene from the third episode, where Ikoma says he could not help his sister. It touches on the subject of family values. The past of Mikasa in Attack on Titan was also like this, and I immediately began to sympathize with her.

***TA:*** I also like this scene. First of all, the voicework of Ikoma is good. His voice fit the scene very well. During this scene, you can also hear the more subdued part of 克JOU気MACHINE.

**Q: The closing theme of the full-length film is the song "ninelie <cry-v>", a new arrangement of the anime ED that Sawano-san wrote.**

***TA:*** Thanks to the new arrangement of the song, the last scene of the film was very emotional and strong. It was very nice.

***HS:*** True. From the very beginning, I was asked to be in the shoes of a listener, and tried to understand the difference between the songs (laughs). Aimer and chelly sang the original song, but this time there was only Aimer, so I borrowed her energy and changed the song. She added a bit of rhythm and several elements fitting to her voice.

**Q: Sawano-san said that the title of the song does not have any deep meaning. But still, it is written for this anime.. so what is the real meaning of ninelie?**

***HS:*** The answer is hidden in the name of the new arrangement of the song. This is "cry", that is, "crying". Also, it was in the lyrics of the song, but when I did the original song I thought the name should be hidden. "Ninelie" is simple wordplay: "c" = 9 = nine, "ry" = lie.

***TA:*** It's quite cool if the fans find the meaning of the song.

**Q: On the site of one fan, I saw a theory that all the stories about Mumei in the anime were all lies. There were nine of these lies, to be specific.**

***HS:*** Really? Well, this corresponds to the main plot. Incredible coincidence is that ninelie was the ninth single of Aimer. I did not know about this, it happened entirely by accident.

**Q: Now I'll ask you about your next work, which was announced recently (the new Kabaneri project). Sawano-san, you said that you heard about it a bit earlier the first time. But what is your opinion now?**

***HS:*** I'm still a bit surprised, because I first learned of the 2nd season before this interview. But I'm looking forward to the continuation, because while working on this anime I thought that there should be a lot more anime like this one. Of course, I am very honored to be able to work on this series again. (laughs)

***TA:*** Of course! It is a great honor for me to ask you to work on this series.

**Q: What kind of work will be next?**

***TA:*** Although I can not go into specifics, it will be a continuation of the story of Ikoma, Mumei, Kurusu and Ayame. At this time I am very enthusiastic to continue.

***HS:*** Araki-san, did you initially think there would be a sequel? Or will there be a whole new story in this setting?

***TA:*** There are nuances that have not been clarified in the anime. Originally, I was planning to show a great story that was not shown in the anime itself. A man named Ikoma is a story about giving up his life for the sake of a girl. I tried to showcase this story, but was not happy with the result. I was extremely dissatisfied with 12 episodes, it was way too little. I wanted to do a lot more episodes.

***HS:*** Wow! I'm looking forward to the new story.

**Q: Sawano-san, tell us what songs we will hear in the next Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress series.**

***HS:*** When I'm responsible for the continuation of any work, I realize that I don't want the main theme to change. The main theme is a song that created the "face" of the entire work itself. Therefore, I want the main theme to stay the same or at least similar. Of course, I know that we need a new sub-theme of sorts. Therefore, I think that to continue Kabaneri, I will change up the old songs. And create a few more new songs as well, that will suit the changes of the sequel.

***TA:*** Of course, some new elements will be added in the future.

## Do as Infinity

> Interview with Do As Infinity & Hiroyuki Sawano, where they talk about their work on the single "Alive / Iron Hornet".

**Q: First of all, please tell us how Do As Infinity and Hiroyuki Sawano started their co-operation.**

***Ryo Owatari:*** For Do As Infinity, we needed something that was different from our previos works. From our staff, I learned about the wonderful man Hiroyuki Sawano, who was very known in the anime world. Honestly at that time, I did not know about Sawano-san. That's why when listening to his work, with the similarities in style, I felt that we could co-operate with this person in the future when we needed something new. But since I was a busy person, I thought that it'd not be easy. I knew that the wife of the Legendoor company and one of our employees were friends, so I asked the employee to introduce us to Sawano.

***Tomiko Van:*** Our staff talked about this during the New Year. At the time I still didn't know of Sawano.

**Q: So what were your thoughts about working with Do As Infinity?**

***Hiroyuki Sawano:*** When I first received the invitation to work with htem, I thought it'd be amazing. Of course, I knew about Do As Infinity, as I had bought their single "Yesterday & Today" when I was still a student. So I thought it would be a very interesting co-operation.

**Q: How did you start working on the songs?**

***Ryo Owatari:*** Before we spoke with Sawano-san, we created a story, and started building the songs with it as a basis.

**Q: What's the story like?**

***Ryo Owatari:*** It'll be released in the future. So until then, please think of the story while listening.

***Hiroyuki Sawano:*** Although "Alive" is a Do As Infinity song, I added my own style to it. I hope I created a song that is fitting for the band itself.

**Q: What were your impressions when you listened to the finished song?**

***Ryo Owatari:*** First of all, I was very impressed that Sawano-san could make such a song in a very short time (laughs). It's amazing that a Japanese composer and his musicians can recreate the core of Western music in such a song.

***Tomiko Van:*** It was the first time that we worked with this type of music. So it took a ***while for me to understand it. I was also worried about the mixture of Japanese and English in the song. But when the song was finished, It was really cool. I was relieved (laughs).

**Q: How did you write the lyrics to the song?**

***Ryo Owatari:*** I wrote the lyrics for the song after understanding the story.

**Q: What about vocals?**

***Tomiko Van:*** Oh, yes. It was something new. I didn't do much, and I had detailed instructions on how to sing the chorus of the song, which was very interesting. It was a revelation for me that my voice could be like that.

***Hiroyuki Sawano:*** The harmony of the chorus is very complicated. The main melody is also very complicated (laughs).

**Q: What kind of imagery is in the song "Iron Hornet"?**

***Ryo Owatari:*** It's something that compliments the song "Alive". Anyways, it's quite a dark worldview with an attempt to see this darker side.

***Hiroyuki Sawano:*** "Alive" is a song with a fast tempo, a song in which electronic sounds are included. In addition, it has Japanese lyrics. The song "Iron Hornet" describes the story that I wanted to do entirely in English, so I asked mpi and Benjamin for the lyrics, both of which I work with all the time.

***Tomiko Van:*** I like Iron Hornet. Because of the English lyrics, the song has a completely different rhythm.

**Q: After these two songs, how do you feel about Sawano-san?**

***Ryo Owatari:*** It was very pleasant to work with Sawano-san.

***Tomiko Van:*** I think he has a unique worldview and sound. I hope that he will be the Japanese version of John Williams (laughs).

***Hiroyuki Sawano:*** Thanks for the comparison with the classic.

**Q: Sawano-san, what are your thoughts about co-operating with Do As Infinity?**

***Hiroyuki Sawano:*** The songs are made by me. But Tomiko's voice and Owatari's guitar made them sound like Do As Infinity. I feel that they have their entirely own sound. They can change it up depending on the song. I feel that I've been influenced by their strength.

**Q: Do you have any thoughts you would like to convey to listeners through this work?**

***Ryo Owatari:*** "Alive / Iron Hornet" will be our first single this year. I would like the listeners to feel our new flow, combined with the sound of Sawano-san.

***Tomiko Van:*** I hope you enjoy the new sound of Do As Infinity.

***Hiroyuki Sawano:*** I want the fans of Do As Infinity to enjoy these songs that have a sense of freedom.

**Q: Are you going to continue your co-operation in the future?**

***Ryo Owatari:*** Actually, I would like to ask Sawano-san to work with us in the future. He's pretty busy, so I do not know when or in what form our next collaboration would be in.

*Also during the interview, Do As Infinity & Hiroyuki Sawano asked each other five questions.*

### Sawano's five questions for Do As Infinity:

**Q1: What CD was the first one you bought?**

***Sawano:*** I don't really have issues with that. Basically I finish my work without my mood changing.

**Q4: What do you do on the weekends?**

***Sawano:*** I watch movies and eat rice. I apologize for the monotony (laughs).

**Q5: What is most important when you feel alive?**
***Sawano:*** Seeing yourself objectively. I recall that I had two traffic accidents in the past.

## SuperGroupies

> Here's the translation for the interview Sawano had with the SuperGroupies Magazine.

*Q: This project is an attempt to look into the personal aspects of people's lives, related to anime, manga, games etc. Our third guest is Hiroyuki Sawano, who has released a new album on September 20th. Sawano-san writes music for anime, namely "MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM UNICORN", "Attack on Titan", Blue Exorcist", "The Seven Deadly Sins" etc. He has also written music for dramas and movies. We heard about his collection of figures and the reasons that he fell in love with these heroes.*

### "The Terminator figure is getting bigger and bigger..."

**Q: You seem to be crazy about all these heroes, since you sent so many photos.**

***HS:*** That's right. Batman, the heroes of American comics, Terminator, Alien, Predator, Gremlins... I really like the characters of Hollywood movies from the 80s and 90s.

**Q: You have a lot of Terminator-related merchandise.**

***HS:*** I bought it all (laughs). Speaking about them, the Terminators have numbers "T-○○○". Arnold Schwarzenegger is the T-800 type. The color, design and specifications are slightly different depending on the number. I think to myself, "oh, this looks cool" and I always end up buying it. When new figures are made, I will have more and more of these in my collection. In addition to the T-800, I've also bought various other types like the T-600 & T-700.

**Q: What made you want to buy and collect the figurines?**

***HS:*** When Terminator 4 came out with Christian Bale being in the title role, this film reminded me that I really wanted a Terminator figure for myself. I didn't see the first Terminator when it came out, but my parents took me to watch Terminator 2. During the show, we received pamphlets with figurines. There was a Terminator model that cost about 5,600 yen. Even now, it's not that cheap, but when I was a kid I couldn't even say that I wanted it. Growing up, I remembered this and I had to look for it online.

**Q: How did you get it?**

***HS:*** My first purchase was a battle version of the T-800 with scratches and such. I wanted something more creative. I was always looking out for a brilliant Terminator. When I bought it, I wanted it to be very similar to the one Stan Stanston created.
"Many different Gundam figures"

**Q: Among your figures there's Gundam figures which aren't from Hollywood.**

***HS:*** This is a figure of the Unicorn Gundam from Mobile Suit Gundam UC, which I made the music for. I also have Sinanju - this is my original figure, made for the Gundam Expo 2016 event. Blue and black colors represent my vocal project [nZk], so that's why the Sinanju also has these colors. Next to that is the Kshatriya.

**Q: How did you get these Gundam figures?**

***HS:*** I've been working on MGUC for about five years. At the time, the producers asked me if I would like to go to France to take a picture. But I haven't had enough flights, and I avoid traveling abroad (laughs). When they asked me to come, I told the producers of what I wanted: "I'll fly if I can get my Kshatriya figure!".  Mobile Suit Gundam UC was also my first work that I worked on for a very long time.

**Q: Are you glad that you went to France?**

***HS:*** The flight itself was a problem (laughs). Usually every person would be happy to travel abroad.

**Q: Is it difficult due to the atmospheric change?**

***HS:*** No, but it's just scary to be in a big car that is flying in the sky! (laughs). In addition, since I don't speak English very well, there are also circumstances in which you go abroad and have problems communicating.

**Q: What is something you like to do daily?**

***HS:*** That would be watching movies and eating rice. I don't go to the cinemas all that often, instead I tend to watch them at home on special TV channels. I also like fig. Eating rice with friends every day is pleasing. Is my life boring? (laughs). I wish I had a more dramatic life (laughs).

**Q: By the way, what's your favorite food?**

***HS:*** Potatoes. I really like potatoes. I'm glad if I can eat potatoes and drink beer. Regardless of which store I go to, I always ask: "Do you have potatoes here?" When I open a menu, I always look for potatoes first (laughs).

### "I've loved heroes since my childhood"

**Q: In addition to the potatoes, Sawano-san, do you like metal and machine-like things?**

***HS:*** Well, I like metallic things, for example I like Iron Man more than Spider-Man. When I was a kid, I liked "Space Sheriff Gavan", "Space Criminal Sharivan", "Space Sheriff Shaider" and "Metal Hero".

**Q: Does the shine of metal or cars interest you?**

***HS:*** Of course. Even when I was making my original album, I said that the album cover would be a supernatural piano machine. There is also a clip of the singer Björk for the song "All Is Full Of Love", in which androids kiss each other. I like her a lot.

**Q: Where's your collection located?**

***HS:*** I've put it in the studio where I work. At first I didn't expect to be able to buy so many things. They're located around the speakers. I put the Terminator's head on the floor, since there was no space for it near the speakers.

**Q: What are the reasons for there being so many characters from 90s Hollywood films in your collection?**

***HS:*** Maybe I wanted to buy them because I found the films to be really cool and interesting. Then again, I was still a child. After all, you can easily recall the impressing that you had when watching movies like Terminator, Alien and Predator. My first movie soundtrack CD purchase was the one for Terminator 2. At the time I was still a child, bu I was impressed by the music playing in the background of the film. I'm grateful to this character for the experiences that I had, and that's why he's in my collection.

**Q: Were there even deeper reasons for buying these particular figures?**

***HS:*** I think that those would be famous quotes in the movies. I really related to the dialogue in the films, and they influenced me so much that I even wanted a collection of the characters from the films. I was impressed by Christopher Nolan, the director of a series of films about Batman, and so I bought character figurines from this series of films.

**Q: It's a great story, is it not?**

***HS:*** I think Christopher Nolan's script is good. And the music is also good. It's strange to say the words of the hero, including Batman's words, but I think he's saying very important things. Even when I work, I reproduce these dialogues from the film in my head. If you think that I've gone mad, I'll say that I have been obsessed with this hero's speeches for a very long time.

### "As the culmination of his collection, he bought the upper part of the T-800"

**Q: And the last question. What have you bought recently?**

***HS:*** That would be the top part of the T-800. I think that my habit of collecting Terminator heads will not stop, so I have to stop it myself. And I thought that if I bought the full Terminator, then it would be a little easier for me. But the full Terminator seems to weigh around 200kg (approx. 440.9 pounds). "I can't move it!". I gave up and only bought the upper body (laughs). Even then, it will be the culmination of my collection.

### From Sawano-san..

For those who are just as crazy:

The influence of your favorite thing is important, and I think it will remain in you forever. Your favorite thing can give you incredible motivation to do something, or it can make you into a madman.
